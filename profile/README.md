### 1. Classical Search Algorithms Explorer

**Description:**
An interactive web application designed to help users explore and understand the concepts of classical search algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **A\* Search Algorithm**. The app provides visualizations and step-by-step explanations to illustrate how each algorithm operates in different scenarios.

### 2. Adversarial Search Game Simulator

**Description:**
An interactive web application that showcases adversarial search in action. In this grid-based game, two robots compete:

- **Good Robot (ü§ñ):** Uses the MINIMAX algorithm (with adjustable depth) to navigate toward a goal (‚ù§Ô∏è) while avoiding danger.
- **Bad Robot (üëæ):** Tries to intercept and zap the good robot using strategies ranging from random moves to MINIMAX with varying depths and different evaluation functions.

Explore how different decision-making strategies play out in a competitive environment as each robot‚Äôs path is visually tracked on the grid.

### 3. Perceptron Visualizer

**Description:**
A dynamic, single-layer perceptron explorer that demonstrates how a single neuron can learn to differentiate between two classes. By adjusting the **weights** and **bias** interactively, you can see how the decision boundary changes in real-time. This tool also includes demos for basic boolean logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR) and additional custom operations. It is a resource for visual learners who wish to understand perceptron fundamentals and the geometry behind linear separability.

### 4. Genetic Algorithm Crossover & Mutation Visualizer

**Description:**
An interactive web tool demonstrating genetic algorithm operations using a simplified **Knapsack Problem** scenario. Each item has a **weight** and **value**, and the **genome** (sequence of 0s and 1s) represents whether an item is picked or not. Users can experiment with different **crossover** strategies (single-point, two-point, k-point, and uniform) and **mutation** schemes (bit-flip, swap, and scramble) to see how new solutions (offspring genomes) are generated in genetic algorithms.
